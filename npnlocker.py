npnlocker.py - Provide easy lock file management as a class

"Dissatisfied with the shape of a perfect circle I've reinvented the wheel, again."

by: nullpass, 2012; based loosely on gekitsuu's Mutex()

2012.08.xx - Initial release
______________________
Logic:
    If lock file does not exist: OK, create

    If lock file exists but proc not running: OK, delete, create
        [Previous instance failed to remove its lock file before exiting]

    If PID running and process matches str(thisExec) and the lock file is older than int(maxage): OK, kill, delete, create
        [A previous instance is stuck, kill it and allow a new instance to run]
        
    If PID running but the name of the process does not match str(thisExec): OK, delete, create
        [Previous instance failed to remove its lock file and some other process spawned later with the same PID]*
        
    If lock file exists, PID running and the process matches str(thisExec): FAIL
        [Previous instance still running, not old enough to kill]
______________________
Examples:

# Try to create a lock file using default settings (see __init__)
#
from npnlocker import Locker
mylock = Locker()
if mylock.create():
    ...
    ...code that requires a lock file here...
    ...
    mylock.delete()


# Try to create a lock file using a custom pid file. 
# Don't allow a previous instance to be killed.
# Set maximum age of the lock file to be 999999999 seconds.
#
from npnlocker import Locker
mylock = Locker()
mylock.lockfile = '/var/run/custom.pid'
mylock.maxage = int(999999999)
mylock.Killable = False
if mylock.create():
    print 'I made a lock file'
    print 'Debugg output: \n'+str(mylock.Trace)
else:
    print 'unable to create lock file'
    print 'Errors: \n'+str(mylock.Errors)
______________________
Notes:

Be mindful of 'thisExec' even if you don't override it with a custom 
name.
The contents of /proc/'oldpid'/cmdline could be anything, and since the
logic only does a very simple substring check you might end up `kill`ing
a legitimate process that has a similar file name or argument. 
For example, if you named your 'thisExec' bob and there was another 
process that started later and happened to re-use the PID for a previous 
instance of `bob` and was named 'john.sh --path=/var/bob' then that 
process would get `kill`ed. 
The self.Killable variable gives you the chance to be careful with 
process management without sacrificing lock file functionality.

*You may think it is rather silly to worry about PID re-use, but I have 
to code on/for systems that stay online for years at a time, some have 
been up for over a decade, but whether or not it makes sense it is still
a valid error condition and one that is easy to check for.

TODO:
    1. os.kill in Locker.murder() needs more testing
    2. Add basic funtionality to main() to allow locking with default 
        settings from the command line. Use sys.exit(0|1) to inform
        caller if locker was successful. --DONE, check main() for usage
